# SQL-Projects
This folder holds the projects conjured using SQL as the main programming/query language. It will also contain projects where excel was used as a visualisation tool.

Football Presentation: 
N.B. for more information and examples, please see the attached ppt presentation 

Brief: 

The company was running a football tournament that consisted of 6 players aside, four teams and 8 groups participating. 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss. My task was to create a relational database that stores all data retrieved from goals scored to whoever got a red card.

ER Design: 
1st experience of drafting an entity relationship diagram. This would summarise structured data through many-to-one and one-to-many connections.

Implementation: 
Using Postgresql, for our DDL, we used the graphical user interface on pg admin 4 to assist in devising the conceptual and logical schema.
All were further populated via DML manually using code

Reflections:
-First experience of ER design 
-First experience of designing relational databases for SQL 
-Exposure to ETL/ELT strategies
